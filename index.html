	<h2>Welcome to my website! It is currently a work in progress :)</h2>

	<!--Intro-->
	<h2>A bit about me...</h2>
	<p>I am a recent graduate of Tufts University, with a Bachelors of Science in Biopsychology '18. I am passionate about learning from the world around me and working to help others-- especially if that work relates to mental health and psychiatry. I have a strong research background, and I plan to continue incorporating my love of science into my life.</p>

	<!--What I am currently doing-->
	<h2>What I am currenly excited about...</h2>
	<p>I am currently working at Spruce Health and driven to help providers communicate efficiently with their patients. As a company, we are striving to make healthcare more accessible with technology. I am currently in a rotational program, so I have the privilege of learning in the roles of customer success and support, sales, and marketing and operations.</p>
	<p>I also adopted a dog this year! Her name is June, and she helps me brighten the world one smile at a time.</p>
